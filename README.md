STUDENT RESULTANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

When this project runs a school login model window would be opened and there would be two buttons present. This can be achieved by adding action performed function to JButton.

 when we click on Admin page and it opens window where upon clicking correct username and password then only next window would be opened if not raises an error.

If we keep correct user and password then it will open another window where many options would be visible and for each there would be a seperate window

We can use the above options to create new student, Add marks to the created student etc attributes to the student.

The updated students list would be seen in List students table.

 And later we can add result to the given student.

If we want to alter any student marks then we can perform that operation by copopulating details of given roll No. and edit new subject marks and save it and then gives a message added successfully

If the student opens a window he can open only by entering correct roll number and number that is present in database. Upon sucessful entering of roll no student can only see his marks and his verdict
